#### Description:
Explore the Graphical Function Plotter, a Python project that transforms mathematical expressions into dynamic plots. This project utilizes the power of Python, incorporating libraries such as matplotlib and numpy to create real-time visualizations of mathematical functions.

The Evaluate class processes mathematical expressions, handling operations like sine, cosine, tangent, logarithms, and more. The code converts expressions to postfix notation, evaluates them, and plots the resulting functions using Matplotlib. The interactive nature of the project allows users to input custom mathematical expressions, providing a hands-on experience in visualizing diverse functions.

The main function initializes the Graphical Function Plotter, prompting users to input a mathematical function. The code then processes and visualizes the function, adjusting the plot's range based on the complexity of the expression. Whether you're a mathematics enthusiast or a Python developer seeking to enhance your skills, this project offers an engaging demonstration of building a function plotter from scratch.

To use the Graphical Function Plotter, run the script and follow the prompts to input a mathematical function. The script dynamically handles various functions, providing insights into the fascinating world of mathematical visualization. The resulting plot showcases the behavior of the input function, offering a practical tool for exploring and understanding mathematical expressions graphically.
